		run_with_daemon_tools_and_ssf.bat
		run_with_mednafen.bat
		run_with_nova.bat
		run_with_powershell_and_ssf.ps1

Q:	My game crash, glitch, show "out of memory" message but why ?
A:	There is a 90% chance that it comes from the memory space reserved for jo_malloc().
	You can change this value in your makefile by adding:
		JO_GLOBAL_MEMORY_SIZE_FOR_MALLOC = 30000
	The default value is 393216 bytes, but when your code grows or you have static data,
	it may exceed the memory size available for your game.
	Attention, jo_malloc () is also used internally.
	
Q:	What is the best format for images ?
A:	Harcoded or Jo Engine Bin format that you can both export from Jo Map Editor.
	More details here: https://forum.jo-engine.org/index.php?board=12.0

Q:	The ratio of sprites displayed is not good. Why ?
A:	Pay close attention to the difference between PAL / NTSC display.
	By default, Jo Engine use NTSC screen resolution (320x240).
	Therefore, if you start the game on a PAL television, the height of the sprites will appear wrong.
	You can change the resolution to PAL in your makefile by adding:
		JO_NTSC = 0
	Note: Some emulators doesn't handle all resolution like SSF which uses 640x480 and 720x480 resolutions.
