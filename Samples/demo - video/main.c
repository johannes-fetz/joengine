** HOW TO CREATE CPK FILE (Work In Progress)
**
** 1) Install ffmpeg: https://www.ffmpeg.org
** 2) Use the following command line:
**    ffmpeg -i SOURCE.AVI -c:a libavformat -f film_cpk -s 320x224 -pix_fmt rgb24 SAMPLE.CPK
**
** Note: The video glitch on SSF and crash Yabause.
**       There must still be values ​​to set on ffmpeg to show the video properly (like tbn and tbc).
